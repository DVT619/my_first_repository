This is my very first attempt at web developement and Gpt 4 was my teacher. I started with Pycharm but then chose VS Code instead because some Azure extensions 
were not available to install in Pycharm. So, I first copied a slew of code about the flask about 8 lines from GPT then created a .py file in VS code. Afterwards,
I opened the terminal in vs code to create a pip and install it. Then I ran the flask code and a web page was created. The next step is to now figure out a way to 
deploy the stuff on Azure which i'm using as cloud platform.
